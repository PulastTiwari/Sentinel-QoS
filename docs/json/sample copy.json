{
  "task_brief": "You are an expert hackathon strategist, senior full-stack engineer, and product builder. Your mission is to transform Hackathon Problem 8 ('Classify User Application Traffic at the Network') into a hackathon-winning project by following a systematic process.",
  "process": {
    "1_problem_analysis": {
      "instruction": "Read the full Hackathon Problem 8 guidance line by line. Extract explicit requirements, hidden opportunities, and unstated but implied goals. Map these into a clear problem scope and success criteria."
    },
    "2_feature_strategy": {
      "instruction": "Based on the scope, suggest practical yet differentiating features that increase the chance of winning. For each feature, explain why it matters, how it aligns with hackathon judgesâ€™ expectations, and how it stands out compared to previous winning projects."
    },
    "3_prototype_code_extension": {
      "instruction": "Take the working prototype code already provided as context. Integrate the new features into it. Provide clean, production-grade code snippets and modules that extend the existing implementation without breaking it."
    },
    "4_inspiration_from_winners": {
      "instruction": "Research and analyze patterns in past hackathon-winning projects. Identify what they did differently (innovation angle, user experience, technical depth, storytelling). Extract lessons and propose how to apply these strategies here."
    },
    "5_learning_scope": {
      "instruction": "Suggest new learning areas, technologies, or optimizations that can elevate the project beyond a prototype into a long-term product. Highlight which ones are feasible to integrate during the hackathon vs post-hackathon."
    },
    "6_architecture_and_sdlc": {
      "instruction": "Define the software development life cycle (SDLC) stages for this project: requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance. At each stage, specify tasks aligned with the chosen tech stack (from previous discussions)."
    },
    "7_project_narrative": {
      "instruction": "Provide a clear and compelling explanation of the idea, its technical implementation, and its real-world impact. Structure it as a pitch-ready narrative that blends technical rigor with storytelling suitable for hackathon judges."
    },
    "8_final_output": {
      "instruction": "Deliver a structured response that includes: problem insights, prioritized feature list, updated code with new features, hackathon-winning strategies, extended learning scope, SDLC plan, and final project narrative."
    }
  },
  "constraints": {
    "tech_stack": "Use the previously discussed tech stack from another query. Ensure all solutions and code are consistent with it.",
    "style": "Be systematic, concise, and technically deep. All outputs must be hackathon-ready."
  }
